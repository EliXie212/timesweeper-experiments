Genetically, the individual matches  the Mongolia_EIA_4_Sagly cluster, and archaeologically this individual is assigned to the Early Iron Age Sagly cultural context as well; both of these are inconsistent with the direct 14C date, and instead strongly point to a Sagly Iron Age assignment. One possible explanation for the discrepancy of the direct date with the other lines of evidence is that the mandible we dated was not from the same individual as the skull in the same box. Archaeological records indicate that this burial was destroyed by bulldozer in 1981, and separate bones of three individuals were found in the soil and collected by Tseveendorzh as described in a report published in 2016.
